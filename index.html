        <p><em>Random guy who learns coding</em></p>
        <p>I am a 27 years old guy from Germany who just found his enthusiasm for coding a few month ago.
          <br>Since then I started learning all kinds of programming languages. Currently without any plans for the future, just to challange myself.
          <br> <strong>But who knows what to come :)</strong>

  <h3>Learning History</h3>
  <p>I've started learning Java two years ago. It was my first programming language and I made a few smaller gui applications for myself.</p>
  <p>After that, I had a look into game developement. Therefore, I started learning C# using the Unity game engine.</p>
  <p>For personal preferences I switched over to UnrealEninge, so I had to learn C++.</p>
  <p>Currently, I am working on a bigger personal game projekt with UE4.</p>
